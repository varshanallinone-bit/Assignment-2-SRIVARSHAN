# Object-Oriented Programming Assignment 2

This repository contains the C++ solutions for the second programming assignment for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at **Sai University – School of Computing and Data Science**.

All programs are written in C++ and include detailed comments. Each solution is accompanied by an explanation of the core OOP concepts used.

## Assignment Questions

1.  **Simple List**: Create a class that behaves like a simple Python list (add, remove, display, size).
2.  **Dictionary/Map**: Design a class that mimics dictionary functionality (key-value pairs, search, display).
3.  **Single Inheritance**: Demonstrate single inheritance with a base `Shape` class and a derived `Rectangle` class.
4.  **Multilevel Inheritance**: Implement multilevel inheritance (e.g., `Person` → `Employee` → `Manager`).
5.  **Multiple Inheritance**: Create a program demonstrating multiple inheritance (e.g., `SportsPerson` from `Person` and `Athlete`) and resolve ambiguity.
6.  **Friend Function**: Write a program where two different class objects share data using a friend function.
7.  **OOP Sorting Algorithm**: Implement a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort) using OOP concepts.
8.  **Polymorphism (Overloading & Overriding)**: Demonstrate function overloading and overriding, explaining compile-time vs. run-time polymorphism.
9.  **Bank Account Class**: Write a `BankAccount` class using constructors, encapsulation, and data hiding.
10. **Abstract Class**: Design an example demonstrating abstract classes and pure virtual functions (`Shape` → `Circle`, `Square`).

## How to Compile and Run

All solutions are in individual `.cpp` files. You can compile them using a C++ compiler like `g++`.

**Example (for Q1):**

```bash
# Compile the program
g++ Q1_SimpleList.cpp -o list_program

# Run the executable
./list_program# Assignment-2-SRIVARSHAN
